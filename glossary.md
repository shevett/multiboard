# Systems and Concepts
* [Multiboard](https://multiboard.io)
  * The modular, free 3d printed storage system created by Jonathan (Keep Making on Youtube).  This is the generic term for components that are designed to interface with the Multiboard standard 25mm panels.
* [Gridfinity]( https://gridfinity.xyz/ )
  * A modular storage system based on (surprisingly) a 3d printed grid. See  for details.
* [Honeycomb]( https://www.printables.com/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall )
  * Another hex-based storage system.  There are adapters and other pieces available to use Honeycomb components with Multiboard.
# Multiboard Subsystems
## Multiboard
Multiboard is the name of the full System and the group components that use it as a wall mounting system(components of this subsystem include Snaps, Tiles, Bolts, and brackets).
## Multibin
Multibin is a new system for bins and drawers that is compatible with multipoint and has a lot of parts
## Multipoint
System that adds a  hybrid dovetail/keyhole connection method for bins and holders, using either circular (point) or long (rail) slots and connectors to attach parts to each other and/or board tiles. It works closely with the Multibin system via the slots on Multibin shells.

## Multigrid(depricated)
Multigrid was the original iteration of the bin system. It is superceded by the multibin subsystem. However if you nee a no frill multiboard compatible bin system than this is it.

# High level components 
### Organized by Subsystem

#### Multiboard
* [Tile]( https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/tiles )
  * The basic component of the wall hanging portion of Multiboard, a Tile is a flat board of hexagonal openings (called 'Multiholes') and pegboard holes that can have a variety of pieces snapped onto it.  Tiles can be joined together to form large scale arrays for storage.
* [Snap]( https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/snaps )
  * A Snap is basically anything that snaps into a tile.  It is hex shaped, and plug sinto the tile without needing to be screwed in.  Snaps tend to be very easy to work with, and can plug and unplug easily.  For stronger items for a tile, use heavy threaded components.
* [Bolt]( https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/bolts )
  * A Bolt is a threaded component that screws into either a Multihole or a Pegboard hole.  Bolts can come in a variety of head types and shapes.
* [T-Bolt]( https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/bolts )
  * A T-bolt is a special kind of bolt that has a T shaped head on it.  
  * Multigrid T-Bolt (Bin to Grid t-bolt? Not sure how different than 'small thread t-bolts') https://than.gs/m/973872 
  * Big, Mid, and Small thread T-bolts https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/bolts 
#### Multibin
* [Shell](https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/multibin/shells)
  * A component of the multibin subsystem that is the outer part of bins and drawers it connects to multipoints and to base plates.
* [Insert]()
  * Internal component of the multibin. This is the piece that you remix to make specific holders.

#### Multipoint
* [Multipoint](https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/multipoint/multipoints) 
  * A circular connector that is the base for the subsystem. Multiple multipoints can be used to function like a rail with the ability 
* [Rail](https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/multipoint/multipoints)
  * long connector for multipoint 

#### Multigrid
* [Bin]( https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/multigrid )
  * A type of storage item that either sits on a multigrid, on a shelf, or hangs directly from the tile.

# [Mounts](https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/mounting-systems)
A mounting system allows a tile to be mounted to a wall (or stood up on it's own).  It's recommended to use an offset mount (which spaces the tile away from the wall)

* Offset Mounts
  * Offset mounts leave an 8mm space between a surface and the tile.
    * A part : the component that attaches to the wall and the tile, leaving an 8mm gap
    * B part : the 'cap' that goes over the A part on the front of the tile, allowing for push connectors and other components to attach, or to just cover up the hole nicely.
* Flush Mount
  * Mounts a tile flush with the mounting surface
* Standing Feet
  * mounting method that allows a tile to stand free from a wall.


# Types of Hangers and Hooks
* [Multiconnect]( https://www.printables.com/model/716558-multiconnect-general-connector-for-your-board/files ) (*Unofficial*)
  * This uses a type of fastener that has a flat shaped disc on it, that slots into the back of components.  It's a very convnient way of hanging items onto your grid.
* Multipoint
  * See [Multipoint](#multipoint) in Subsystems

# Hole types
* Pegboard Holes
  * 25mm apart and can hold up to 20kg.
  * Small thread bolts and other objects can be screwed into these holes.
  * Accepts existing pegboard accessories from other systems.
* Multiholes
  * are 25 mm apart, and allow you to insert snaps or screw in bolts that have a big thread.
  * 25 mm apart, and allow you to insert snaps or screw in bolts that have a big thread.
* Push fit Head
  * A fitting that can take a 'mid size' thread bolt into it as a push / quick connect.
